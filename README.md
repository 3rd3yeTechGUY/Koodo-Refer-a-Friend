# Koodo-Refer-a-Friend bonus cash

Why Do I Need Referral To Sign Up?

With referral, you get $25, sometimes doubled to $50 from Koodo Mobile as credit to offset your future POSTPAID bill.

*Note: From April 13 to May 10, 2018, bonus is $50 !! Enjoy!*

How Does It Work?

## Step 1. (BEFORE you go sign up with Koodo Mobile)

https://referafriend.koodomobile.com/3f2Z4Po-5UYqDPN?lang=en

and provide you full name and email on the page above. Once this step is done, there will be an email from Koodo Mobile, which will be needed later.

## Step 2. 

Go to a Koodo Mobile kiosk in a mall, or any third party dealer such as Walmart/Best Buy/The Mobile Shop/London Drugs/WOW Mobile and get your Koodo Mobile phone number as a new customer. Not only new sign-ups, but also port-in, add-a-line, and transferred from Koodo Mobile prepaid are all considered as NEW CUSTOMER.

## Step 3 (Very Important,)
Remember the email we got from Step 1? Find it (maybe in SPAM), and there is a link. Click it and submit your Koodo Mobile phone number. Thatâ€™s it! All done!

Notes:
This bonus referral credit only applies to POSTPAID customers. (on a plan)
Just signed up and forgot to take advantage of referral program? No hurt to try. Sometimes Koodo Mobile does give credit to late submission.
